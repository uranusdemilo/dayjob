   <div class = "pageinfo">August 17, 2003.  My last day as a salaried employee.  A regular assignment is
   strangely cancelled for me to attend a "pre-sales" meeting with four other people.  The meeting is pushed
   back...management is acting strangely.  I get a bad feeling....   By mid-morning no client is in 
   sight, and we see my boss and the HR person setting up shop in the conference room.  Thirty minutes
   later, all four of us have our walking papers and we all head out the door into one of the worst
   employment markets the IT industry has ever seen....  The other three file for unemployment.  I
   file for a business licencse with the city of San Francisco.
<BR><BR>
Flying Bovine is a one-man shop operating out of my aparttment in the Noe Valley
District  of San Francisco. It was my means of keeping my head afloat during rocky economic times, 
while staying active in a field that I love which is enduring a bad job market.  Most importantly, 
it allows me to approach computing support from an angle of my own choice...to practicing a philosophy
 of treating the staff who use a system or network as a part of it, assisting people in the daily use
 of what computing resources they have at their disposal, and providing them with a system they view
 not as a necessary evil, but a vital part of their productivity.
<BR><BR>
What makes me different?  Whereas most computer people see a given system as the sum of its hardware 
and software, I go a step further and see the people using it as a part of the system.  I'm good 
at helping people when they're confused.  I can ease frustrations when things get confusing.  And I
 can calm people when they start pointing fingers and yelling.  Where large number of computer people are content to sit back in the network room, idly tinkering with routers and servers, I take pride in my ability to learn people's names, take note of their personalities, and evaluate their place in the systems overall effectiveness.
<BR><BR>
Lastly, I like doing things an affordable fashion...The latest, greatest, and fastest equipment out
 there can do some pretty amazing things, but not everybody needs it.  I can give an individual or 
 business a proper perspective on what they need in a system or how they can improve their old one, 
 and do so from the point of a neutral consultant rather than a commissioned salesperson<BR><BR>.</div>
