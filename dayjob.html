            <p style="padding-left:10px"><paratext>To say that Microsoft Windows is virus-prone is an understatement.
            More accurately, Windows is an incubator for viruses, a petri-dish like environment
            where malicious code is allowed to flourish while playing hide-and-seek amidst a 
            labrinth-like maze of system files and registry settings. They crash your system,
            slow it down, bombard you with advertisements, and even prevent it from booting. 
            The sofware industry has spawned a dazzling array of "Security Suites" to deal with
            the issue....sometimes they work, sometimes they don't....</paratext></p?>

            It's usually the one that you gave to that nitwit administrative assistant that did little
            more than screw around on the interent for 8 hours a day. It's had every chat client,
            browser toolbar, and search assistant under the sun loaded on it...and as a result, It's slow,
            freezes regularly, and constantly has to be rebooted. Employees find it impossible to get
            anything done on it, and begin to avoid it like the plauge. It's labeled as a bad machine...but
            there's probably not much wrong with it...</paratext></p>

            22 different viruse, 16 adware attacks, and every internet search and toolbar under the sun
            installed on it. It may complain of missing files or services it can't start. Fixing a system
            like this is dooable, but it's a real pain-in-the-ass. In this instance, I usually reccomend
            what I call wiping the system
